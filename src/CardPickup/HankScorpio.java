/**
 * Some important variables inherited from the Player Class:
 * protected Node[] graph; //Contains the entire graph
 * protected Hand hand; //Contains your current hand (Use the cardsHole array list)
 * protected int turnsRemaining; //Number of turns before the game ends
 * protected int currentNode; //Your current location
 * protected int oppNode; //Opponent's current position
 * protected Card oppLastCard;	//Opponent's last picked up card
 * 
 * Important methods inherited from Player Class:
 * Method that is used to determine if a move is valid. This method should be used to help players
 * determine if their actions are valid. GameMaster has a local copy of this method and all the
 * required variables (such as the true graph), so manipulating the variables to turn a previously
 * invalid action in to a "valid" one will not help you as the GameMaster will still see the action 
 * as invalid.
 * protected boolean isValidAction(Action a); //This method can be used to determine if an action is valid
 *
 * NOTE TO STUDENTS: The game master will only tell the player the results of your and your opponents actions.
 * It will not update your graph for you. That is something we left you to do so that you can update your
 * graphs, opponent hand, horoscope, etc. intelligently and however you like.
